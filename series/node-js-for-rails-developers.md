Are you a <em>Ruby on Rails</em> developer interested in learning <em>Node.js</em>?
This series of blog posts will guide you through the process of
  installing <em>NPM</em> packages,
  configuring a new <em>Express.js</em> application,
  connecting it to a datastore (either <em>PostgreSQL</em> or <em>MongoDB</em>),
  and deploying your app to a production <em>Heroku</em> server.
