NOTES:

Open data portals:
 + how gov shares data with the general public
 + an important first step
 + provide transparency
 + foster collaboration
 + require exploration of business processes

Organizations must:
 + improve business processes
 + sever monolithic systems into smaller, more specific micro-services, each with its own API

todo: check to see the extent to which a data file can be programmatically uploaded/updated to a socrata-run open data portal.

todo: research the costs of hosting via socrata and compare to the cost of self-hosted API servers
