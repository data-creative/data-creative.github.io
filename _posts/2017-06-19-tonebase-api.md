ToneBase is a web-based information system designed to facilitate online music instruction through the posting, curation, and viewing of online videos. The [ToneBase API 1.0](https://tonebase-api.herokuapp.com/) provides a RESTful back-end web service to power the [front-end client application](https://tonebase.co/).

The API was commissioned by the [ToneBase Team](https://twitter.com/tonebaseteam) comprised of student fellows from the [Yale Entrepreneurial Institute](https://www.city.yale.edu/) (YEI), who built the front-end interface themselves.

## Project Management

This project was planned, designed, and developed in less than 45 days using a traditional ("waterfall") systems development methodology.

The project consisted of a "Discovery Phase" followed by a ten day "Planning Phase", followed by three week-long "Development Sprints", followed by a week-long "Maintenance Phase".

### Discovery Phase

The client posted the job over email to a local technology group. I responded to the request and met with clients twice to further discuss overall product vision and scope. As a result, I prepared and delivered a "Scope of Services" document which would outline the terms of the engagement.

### Deliverable: Scope of Services Document

The Scope of Services document was an essential part of the success of this project. It established mutual expectations and a shared understanding between developers and clients. It specifically defined the system scope and goals, but did not assume to predefine any specific technical requirements.

The document included the following sections:

  1. Project Description
  2. Participant Roles
  3. Project Goals
  4. Project Phases (including dates)
  5. Project Deliverables (including dates)
  6. Developer Services
  7. Terms of Participation
  8. Payment Schedule and Methods
  9. Signatures

### Planning Phase

It took around ten days of intermittent client meetings to translate conceptual ideas and user stories into a tangible system design.

As a result of this phase, I produced a Technical Requirements Document, including a Data Flow Diagram, a Database Architecture Diagram, and a Server Architecture Diagram.

#### Deliverable: Requirements Document

The Technical Requirements Document specified the specific system scope and requirements. It said what the system should do.

It included the following sections:

  1. System Description
  2. Information Requirements
  3. System Architecture
  4. User Roles and Permissions
  5. System Functionality (desired features for each user role)

Crafting a quality requirements document is essential to minimizing ambiguity and maximizing productivity and efficiency during the development phase. A good technical requirements document lends itself to be directly translated into subcomponent developer tasks.
