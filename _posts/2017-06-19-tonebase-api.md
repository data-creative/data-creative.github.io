ToneBase is a web-based information system designed to facilitate online music instruction through the posting, curation, and viewing of online videos. The [ToneBase API 1.0](https://tonebase-api.herokuapp.com/) provides a RESTful back-end web service to power the [front-end client application](https://tonebase.co/).

The API was commissioned by the [ToneBase Team](https://www.f6s.com/tonebaseinc1) of student fellows from the [Yale Entrepreneurial Institute](https://www.city.yale.edu/) (YEI), who built the front-end interface themselves.

## Project Management

This project was planned, designed, and developed in around five weeks using a traditional ("waterfall") systems development methodology.

The project consisted of a "Discovery Phase" followed by a ten day "Planning Phase", followed by three week-long "Development Sprints", followed by a week-long "Maintenance Phase".

### Discovery Phase

The client posted the job to a local New Haven meetup group email list. The development team met with clients twice to discuss overall product vision and scope. Then the development team prepared and received client approval on a "Scope of Services" document before proceeding.

### Scope of Services Document

The Scope of Services document was an essential part of the success of this project, and the primary reason for the success of the waterfall methodology. It established mutual expectations and a shared understanding between developers and clients. It specifically defined the system scope and goals. And it left room for the ambiguity associated with sub-component agile sprints.

The document included the following sections:

  1. Project Description
  2. Participant Roles
  3. Project Goals
  4. Project Phases (including dates)
  5. Project Deliverables (including dates)
  6. Developer Services
  7. Terms of Participation
  8. Payment Schedule and Methods
  9. Signatures

### Planning Phase

It took around ten days of on and off client meetings to translate client ideas and user stories into a system design.

As a result of this phase, the development team produced a Technical Requirements Document, including a Data Flow Diagram, a Database Architecture Diagram, and a Server Architecture Diagram.

#### Requirements Document

The Technical Requirements Document specified the specific system scope and requirements. It said what the system should do. Crafting a quality requirements document , and thus reduces mabiguity and ___ during the development phase.
